    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dear Mrs Poh, </p>
    <p>Thank you for being such a great form, cmath and amath teacher over the past 2 years! Without you, I would never have understood all the tough amath concepts and managed to pull up my amath scores especially last year when I almost failed my WA... TT you are a brilliant teacher and I'm so grateful we had you for both math subjects in upper sec. Your teaching really laid the foundation for us!</p>
    <p>I really appreciate your care for our class and the amount of effort you put into nurturing us and guiding us back onto the right path. I know we can be very difficult at times and I'm so grateful for your patience and love! Besides that I also admire how you are so rooted in Christ and always share your experiences and aim to bring God's love to your people around you. I also loved our group TPC sessions and talking to you!</p>
    <P>I hope you get a good rest over the holidays and take some time for yourself! Hope we stay in touch :) thank you for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è</P>

    <p> </p>
    <p>Love,</p>
    <p>Samantha Kunafi (sam k!)
