    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dearest Zoe,</p>
    <p>Happy grad! Thanks for being one of the best seat partners and waa partners I could ever ask for. I know we don’t talk as much now but anyway you are so so kind and sweet and I am so grateful for you and cherished every day that I sat next to you. Thank you for trekking through the fields with me and getting our socks and shoes all muddy together (but lets never do that again) and thank you for tolerating my bs, entertaining my randomness and just being such a kind soul in general. You deserve so much love and more and I am so blessed to be your friend and to have had so many chances to sit beside you in class! Like wow I really lucked out HAHA. </p>
    <p>As we move into this next chapter of our lives I wanted to tell you to ALWAYS believe in yourself, stand your own ground and never let anybody talk down to you! Stay safe please you deserve so so much and amazing amazing friends. You are such a capable person you're actually a genius in more ways than one bro no kidding and I believe in you!</p>
    <p>I love you so so much Zoe, I hope our paths cross many many times again in ACSI and we stay in touch throughout the years! Stay amazing and never lose sight of your unique self ❤️❤️</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Lots of love,</p>
    <p>sam k ur forever deskie in spirit</p>
