    </p>
    <p>you are such a great leader, i rlly admire how you confidently take charge and can take the initiative to lead a grp and scold our noms (LOL) and knock some sense into the rest of the comm when we need it. esp for ltc last year you were truly such a great oic!!! u are also super overworked bro with olevels and hl and football and mr ling being super irritating, uve really had a crazy crazy year and life in mg and u really deserve a good break over the hols bro. youre so hardworking and i rlly look up to u for that!!! pls dont stress too much about your results, you deserve this time to zzz, get ur beauty sleep and take care of urself! pls get a good rest okay  </p>
