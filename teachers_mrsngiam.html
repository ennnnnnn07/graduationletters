    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dear Mrs Ngiam,</p>
    <p>Thank you for being such a great LA teacher these past 2 years! You truly light up our lives and I'm so grateful that I had you as my LA teacher. Without you I think I would never have discovered a passion for analysing texts and my grades would never have improved... I am not kidding when I say that this is the first year I've even glimpsed a 7 for an assessment based on a book...</p>
    <p>I appreciate your constant encouragement and how you always check in on our class' welfare! Our class loves you so much hahaha truth be told I think at first we were a little intimidated by your height.. and it's super funny how every teacher who comes in after you needs to lower the little white table down HAHA</p>
    <p>Anyway, I love your lessons and I'm very very sad to be leaving for ACSI because I will not see you there... and it is for this reason that I will be taking SL langlit and not SL lit because I am extremely unsure of my ability to do well with just lit... </p>
    <p>My main point here is that no one is as GOATED 🏆 as you and you're truly an amazing, bombastic, caring and wonderful teacher in all aspects. I hope you have a great holiday and get a wonderful amount of sleep every day (and stop sleeping past midnight anymore)! Thank you so much for everything and please dont forget 4T we love you so much 😛</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Love,</p>
    <p>Samantha Kunafi (sam k!)
