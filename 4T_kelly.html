    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dear Kelly,</p>
    <p>It's been a crazy 3 years and I'm glad I got to spend them with you. wait damn that sounds so emo let me restart 😂😂😂 Ok so. Thank you for being my friend for the past three years! It's been literally so crazy like going from 2r to 3t to now, I'm so grateful that we met in 2022 and have stayed in the same class! I miss our long Xiaomi chat conversations and your random pickup lines like bro those were GOLD. Still in awe of your genius. Thanks for being the best admin subcomm ic ever, tolerating my bs, replying in my channel etc etc! Also thanks for letting me into your class photo group.... I am forever grateful for you and shaun and dre and ash</p>
    <p>Also I cannot thank you enough for being such a sweet kind soul like OH my days thank you so much for always being there for me! You always send me long texts after I've had a hard day and u do NOT know how much of an impact theyve had on my life like seriously idk how you alw know what to say but I am so grateful youre there for me. I rmb in July like okay idk if you remember or if u knew who the friend I was talking about was but I had this huge miscommunication w Elizabeth lim and it affected me super bad like all I could do for the entire night was just cry and eat acai like a loser 😭😭😭😭 And after I sorted that out I was still feeling kinda lost but seeing your text was like. Getting a nice warm hug. Like that's how it made me feel 🙁🙁🙁🙁 and like that weekend when I was scared that she was mad at me (She wasnt) and posted this emo thing in my channel, you replied so encouragingly... Like I rmb I was sitting in coffee bean and tea leaf mugging for amath and I just saw your reply in my tele notifs and that was like a big punch in the gut but like a good punch??? Like a punch of love if u know what I mean 😭😭😭 I guess what I'm trying to say is that someone needs to invent a new word for thank you cause I'm using it too much in this letter... Words literally can't express my gratitude towards you</p>
    <p>Besides that I feel like I told u this at some point but u are really one of my biggest role models. Like ure so tall bro. HAHAHHAHA JUST KIDDING ure one of my biggest role models cause I admire how you are so driven and hardworking. You have so much on your plate and yet you still find time to care for those arnd you and wait off topic but idk how you come up with your jokes but they're actually so funny like even though we're all like "Haha Kelly ur jokes are not funny haha" BUT SERIOUSLY THEY ARE SO FUNNY like idk how you do it what are you eating.....</p>
    <p>Anyway returning to my original point you're so cool and capable and I think very very often that it's so crazy that I am friends with you 😭 You are crazy good at math and so hardworking and diligent and driven and just like. So fire in general. I literally can't even express it in words but ure crazy good. In all aspects. I admire your perseverance and I have so much respect for you. Pls don't burn out in acsi and rmb to take lots of breaks!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Anyway we better stay in touch in acsi if not I will be crying over that next.... Hope you have a lovely holiday and let's go out sometime 😁😁😁 Love U lots</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Lots and lots and lots of love and jokes and fun and laughter,</p>
    <p>SAM K!!!!!</p>
    <p> </p>
