    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dearest shaun,</p>
    <p>Happy grad! I’m so glad I had the chance to meet you through MG hehe thank you for the past three years ❤️❤️❤️ Thank you for being such a great group mate for Chinese last year and a super strong leader for welfare comm. Truth be told I was kinda scared of you at first but as time went by and I got to know you better, ive realised that youre not just a great leader but also an extremely kind and thoughtful friend and I want to thank you a hundred times for that! So glad we got closer over the past 2 yrs and became better friends 😁</p>
    <p>You led the class so well last year like you and emz are truly truly goated class chairs and I cannot think of anyone who was more suited to lead our class.</p>
    <p>I admire how you are so super hardworking and always put in your 200% to reach your goals. Youve been one of my main role models especially throughout eoy season and seeing your insane todo lists in your channel is always a wake-up call for me 😭😭😭 Besides that I admire how rooted in Christ you are and how you work for God and not other people, it’s so inspiring for me ++ also thank you for inviting me to your church events! Although I’m still not allowed to go (and I hope one day I will be...) I really appreciate your effort and thought! Also I love your jewelry collection HAHA your earring choices are top tier. Thanks for looking out for me and always checking in on me too! I appreciate you so so much</p>
    <p>I hope we stay as close next year, throughout our time in acsi and even after we graduate (although that's still some time away lol)! I will be there for every tele channel roll call 💯</p>
    <p>Remember to take breaks okay and dont burn out cause u study like crazyyyyy and I admire that but at the same time you need to take some time for yourself too! Love you so so much shaun stay strong and safe and healthy and see you in acsi pookie 😁😁</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Love and warm hugs,</p>
