    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dearest sophlee,</p>
    <p>Happy grad! It's actually crazy that I met you in sec 1 lol. I thought (and still think!) that you were so cool and your art was literally out of this world ok and every time u post in your art channel my eyes are blessed 😭 anyway, thanks for being such a steady and great friend esp these past 2 years and being such a solid group mate! Thank you for doing chem and physics apt with me, helping me buy stuff from tele, going for gopizza with me and making our fdd spreadsheets (I still think that was so funny) and more! It's been a crazy ride and I am so grateful I was able to be in the same class as you in upper sec.</p>
    <p>I love reading your channel updates and learning more about the world of prsk merch (I havent played in a while I need to get back into it.....) and seeing your beautiful art pls never stop creating 🙏 I also love your cookies PLSSS I usually don't eat cookies much but when u bring your yummy delicious amazing cookies to class it is really free for all! And your lunchbox cake like woahhhh. You are so talented and hardworking (seriously) and I can see how much effort you put into everything like actually! And it's so crazy how you stay on top of managing pineapple pond 🍍 and studying and still manage to find time for art and stuff, I think that’s smt I really look up to you for. This year has been quite rough but I'm glad we got through it together!</p>
    <p>Besides that I also wanted to thank you for supporting me esp through my ugly crying era in July 🤔 Thanks for listening to me yap about Elizabeth lim esp when I was not friends w her yet......... I know I can get quite annoying 😂😂 And thanks for staying with me even when I was down and crying in the middle of nowhere, I really appreciate it so so much and your humour makes everything better no jokee and OMD this is from so long ago but having you sit close to me in jap in sec 1 was a real blessing esp after I beefed with shannyn.... LOLOLOL BUT YAH your presence is much appreciated and I'm so grateful for you</p>
    <p>Hope we can take pcm together next year and stay close throughout our acsi life too 🥰🥰 stay amazing pookie I love u so muchhh</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Kisses and pisses (ok idk why i said that),</p>
