    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>My beloved charis goh,</p>
    <p>SO MUCH LOVE OMDS. Words literally can't express how grateful I am for you wtf I'm SO glad that God put you in my life and we had the opportunity to meet in sec 2. Okay I'm gonna go in chronological order</p>
    <p>I actually hate who I was in sec 2 and I'm super sorry for anything i may have done to inconvenience you lol... but I'm so glad you were my vice chair like I literally cant imagine working with anyone else but yah that was a super funny time... working with mrs chia and laoshi........ One of my core memories is def picking out emojis to sign off our messages with and planning kahoots and drafting our reminder messages with HAHAHAHAH but sec 2 was actually a fever dream lol... </p>
    <p>Anyway fast forwarding to sec 3 now! I actually have no idea how we became so close but I'm so grateful we did cause I don't know who I would be without you. Gohgohs ship will never samk was actually peak and I'm kinda sad we stopped talking in there (I lowk drifted from ashley a lot too but anyway) but I'm super glad we had that gc! And in sec 4 so so glad for you and arielle and kim, even through the fg drama and being kinda lost I love that our friendship is super steady</p>
    <p>I wanted to thank you for being one of the best friends I could ever ask for UNIRONICALLY. U are so hardworking, talented, diligent, neat (seriously ure a model student), caring, kind, thoughtful, smart, and literally just pull up a positive adjectives list and read it for yourself cause I could go on for days. It's so crazy how youre so focused and diligent and I look up to you so so much! I can see how much effort you put into your studies bruh... Thank you for reminding me to NOT get on my phone when I study and always answering my questions esp about math...</p>
    <p>Besides that, thanks for always being there for me... I'm ab to cry writing this again but youve really been one of the main reasons why I'm not like crying every day and depressed esp this year HAHAHAHA thank you for taking long walks with me around the school and listening to me talk about my problems and being so encouraging and supportive. Thank you for staying online with me throughout my episodes of sadness and offering me your love and support every single time! I think you know esp which time I'm talking about but yah that time w me and Eliz was super crazy and I actually have no idea how my eyes produced so many tears in the span of two days.... But anyway I literally have so much to thank you for just for those two days. Like I remember how I was like "ok we'll come back at xxx time!" AND I remember you said you had a lot of work to do... but then I ended up sobbing my eyes out and you STILL walked with me. Like you could have sat my ass down and reminded me we needed to grind but you chose to walk w me and offer me encouraging words and literally GOLDEN advice and give me reality checks.</p>
    <p>And when we were about to bump into eliz Woah! That was a close call! You were so mindful of my feelings and I still feel really bad for wasting your time... And even when I was stressing about whether or not she replied me, you reminded me to get off my phone and study and I actually wouldn't have been able to lock in that day if you weren't there. And also my acai eating adventures and only being able to cry and eat acai ................ Thanks for listening to my voice recs and staying online w me cause I was actually panicking so hard it seems dumb now but it was just so real at the time. And even the next day BRO I'm literally such a crybaby but thanks for sticking with me through it all. I hope this bs never happens to us cause I would just like. Kms... (Sorry for the many kms jokes but I think theres actl no hope for me if we ever drift)</p>
    <p>You are so hardworking, kind and talented and so good at time management I actually don't know how you manage to keep on top of everything that you do... especially like church and worship practice bro it's actually so crazy. And we love our committed queen but please don't overcommit and burn out especially in acsi!!! like esp since u joined project puedo (ure gna be the coolest comm head ever) and I know that IB is going to get tough so I pray that we'll be able to stay close and get through it together so yeah!!!</p>
    <p>I also really want to thank you also for always looking out for me and sending me encouraging messages like I remember that after my horrendous exchange with Mrs Poh about cmath coursework when she told us that we were going to fail and then I was just like working on it and all my group mates were offline... you sent me this really encouraging message and it was just so heartening??? idk the word for it but I can't believe that you took the time to to write all of that out for me and I'm so so grateful for your steady presence in my life!!!!</p>
    <p>I just love our friendship cause it's so like uplifting and also I really admire you for being so rooted in Christ! Thank you for always sending me Bible verses and always listening to me talk about church and also thank you so much for inviting me to your church even though I'm not allowed to go... but I really appreciate it!!!! I hope that one day i'll be able to go and maybe come back to mg tgt for love mg if im allowed to but yeah lol! I really really hope that everything will be okay and we better stay close if we don't I will come find you and I'll bite you.</p>
    <p>Let's go out soon for some good acai and study together next year and go out sometime and maybe like go do some fun things and I don't know I'm just so so excited for the holidays! (This was written on 10 Nov)</p>
    <p>I hope that we stay close through it all and that you have really have the best holidays ever and please get a good rest cause you deserve it ok!!!</p>
    <p>Charis I love u so so much thanks for everything!!!!!!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Kisses and hugs and love and joy,</p>
    <p>samantha!!!!!!!</p>
