    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dear Mr Ow,</p>
    <p>Thanks for being such a great teacher both in school and in church. I love your dry humour and the unique way in which you make your lessons engaging! You really livened up GS for us and helped me to understand the concepts way better. Also, thank you for helping me and Zarah print out our board for Elly Koh's birthday... we were really desperate and you really saved us there.. and thanks for patiently marking the essay I submitted late. Besides that you're also the MVP of MGS.. I remember when you went on course earlier this year and everything had to be stopped because you were not there HAHA. But please take some breaks and don't get sick, I hope you're not overworking yourself and you get a good rest over the holidays! Thank you for also looking out for me in church and patiently answering my gs questions after sunday school ends too! You're not just a great GS teacher but also a brilliant catechist and I'm so glad you were my teacher. Actually one of my biggest fears is accidentally calling you Uncle Chris in school HAHAHA 
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, thank you for everything and I hope to see you around in church more! Have a good holiday and get some rest!</p>
    <p> </p>
