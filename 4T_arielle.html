    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dearest Arielle,</p>
    <p>Happy graduation! I think it's actually so crazy that we've actually been in the same class for 3 yrs (+ sec 2 jap too) haha it doesn't feel like that long </p>
    <P>I'm actually so grateful that you were there to get through jap in sec 2 with me and I'm so grateful that it ended up like that ... even though I was kind of bummed out that I wasn't in the same class as a lot of mg people after you and anna quit but honestly I think it worked out for the best</P>
    <p>Also so u know how I always talk about that turning point in my life! I was actually really scared to sit beside you in sec 3 cause I wasn't sure if we would vibe or if we were going to be good friends but then I realized that you're actually such an amazing person and I'm so so grateful to shauna and emma for putting me beside you!!! You are seriously a turning point in my life - you're just such an uplifting and supportive friend and I really really want to thank you for that fact and you are in so many of my core memories like studying for doas tgt, watching you write your psl speech and like reading all your funny fruit analogies HAHAHAHA wait I'm really still so proud of that</p>
    <p>And getting through everything like HL results and so much more, it's just really so crazy how much we've been through together especially as deskies and I am really really grateful that we had the opportunity to sit beside each other</p>
    <p>Also thankkkk you again for being such a nice friend and always listening to me and tolerating my bs even though I know I can be a bit delusional sometimes ... and I'll talk about a lot of things that are really quite unrealistic or gossip üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ and I'm really grateful that you always give me a reality check and you're always there to guide me back onto the correct path. </p>
    <p>I really love the various types of note paper that you write your cards on (ive kept all of them in my drawer don't worry!) and I really appreciate all the Bible verses that you have written on many many cards for me!</p>
    <p>I really love working together with you for things like MI (SO GLAD WE WERE PAIRED TGT), amath WAA and also like cmath coursework even though it kind of turned out badly but it's okay cause we spent it togetherüò≠üò≠üò≠ and I'm really grateful that I was able to work with you and we actually got through it together ... which is so crazy to me and I'm just so so grateful that we were able to get through 2 years of school together!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Also thank you for accepting me to your lunch group and supporting me even though I ditched my friend group üòÖ and thank you for like letting me into your FDD table as well .. Thank you so much for supporting me basically and for being there for me in general, I just love you so much and I really couldn't imagine what my 2023 and 2024 would have been like without you.</p>
    <p>I want to also affirm you for your hard work!!!! I can really see all the effort that you put in into literally everything that you do whether it be your academics or PSL or your friendships, I'm really grateful for the amount of effort that you put into everything and I really look up to you cause you are so hardworking and you're just so focused and you have an incredible amount of mental willpower and resilience and you're also a good sibling ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è don't worry too much ab ur psl jnrs okay im sure they will be fine + ure rlly a great senior!</p>
    <p>I really think you're actually like one of my biggest role models and I'm so so grateful that we are friends now! I really hope that throughout acsi we'll continue to stay close because I really love this uplifting friendship of ours and no matter what, I hope that you know that I love you and no matter what comes in acsi will get through it together!!!!!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>So much love,</p>
