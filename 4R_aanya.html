    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>dearest AANYA....</p>
    <p>happy graduation to my favourite tele hater! (actl kind of funny how i got insta and u got tele... we are such positive peer influences!) it's honestly crazy how we were friends in sec 1 then kinda reconnected this yr. so very glad that we met early on in our mg lives and we became friends! i will nvr forget ur unhinged quotes in 1R LOL! and our long conversations at the lunch table aft swimming, that era was so fun honestly</p>
    <p>thanks for being such a sweet and kind friend! ure so supportive and thoughtful and i love talking to u, ure so fun. your humour is actl damn funny but forget i admitted that pls. i love yapping w u cause it never gets boring, and i also love studying w u even though we always end up yapping instead of studying!!!! idk why but we are actually such a goated team esp for la cheatsheet we rlly cooked w that bro wtf. this is a sign for us to study tgt more in acsi (and for u to take pcme so we end up in the same class yayay) so we both graduate with a perfect 45 points (manifesting)</p>
    <p>that said, ure super hardworking and rlly smart like i can rlly see how much effort u put into ur studies. the whole memory palace thing was freaking insane and i still have no idea how u cooked that up. youre pretty insane in general. in a good way or in a bad way u can decide (KIDDING)</p>
    <p>i love how we match energy and alw can find something to yap about, even at the wrong times when we're supposed to be studying! but it's ok life is short, we shld spend it having long conversations. hoping we have more yap sessions in acsi and we can hang out more in future! lets study more tgt and pls stop fighting w me over who gets to sit beside elizabeth lim ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ anyway hoping u have a brilliant holiday and all ur dreams (unless ur dream is to sit beside elizabeth lim) come true!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>lots of love,</p>
    <p>sam k!!</p>
