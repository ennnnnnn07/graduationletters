    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dearest Kezia,</p>
    <p>Happy graduation! You are one of the funniest people I know (in a good way).  The end</p>
    <p>Just kidding HAHAHA okay I'm really grateful that we ended up in the same class in sec 2 and remained in the same class for upper sec too. I feel like we don't interact a lot in class but when we do talk I know I'm in for a good time. I love your insightful insights, questioning questions and amazing attempts at trying to get yhr fired (That lesson was actually unironically one of the most interesting chem lessons we've had in 2024...) LOLLLL and I love the energy and vibe you bring to our class! Your peak presentation was super funny and I enjoy listening to your jokes, random inputs and reading your funny ass poems</p>
    <p>Besides that, you're one of the best friends I could ever ask for and always so steady! Thanks for being a wonderful obs group mate I actl think I wouldn't be able to get through it without you. I loved spilling tea w u and vivianne and lying awake in the tent and our night prayers and everything like UGHH that was so peak I hope we can all get tgt again and go out or something TT TT and thanks for being such a great deskie, the group w u me emz and zoe was actually so goated too and I would never have been able to learn differentiation without the three of you lol.. </p>
    <p>Hope we stay close throughout acsi and can go out sometime! If I end up being unable to come to your bday party (touchwood) I'll be there in spirit u better save me a slice of cake!</p>
    <p>(THIS WAS WRITTEN IN NOV.... like... 10 nov... anyway thanks for inviting me to your birthday party im sorry i was so out of it cause of my stomach...... but it was so fun and ur cake is so iconic i love it! lets hang out more next year ok)</p>
