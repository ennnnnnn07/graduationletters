    <p>happy graduation!! thankyou for being the first closest friend i made in mg and for going through so much with me! i am so glad we met in sec 1 and have stayed friends till now, i literally cant imagine my life without you. you are such a sweet and kind friend, thank you for alw being there for me and listening to my random bs and tolerating my yap all the time! ive gone through so much with you and i cldnt imagine doing it with anyone else. i love sitting beside u in cca (even if we didnt do much cca stuff tgt this year) and not paying attn with you! (lol) i also loved gg to the escape room w u and ur friends (although that was MAD terrifying lets do something more calm and less traumatic next time we hang out! idw to see any more limbs or blood bruh)</p>
