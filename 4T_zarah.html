    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dearest zarah,</p>
    <p>I can’t believe we have known each other for three years now! I am so glad I got to know you super early on in 2022 and I am like a hundred percent sure I would not have been able to get through it without you. Thank you for being one of my first friends in 2r, being so supportive, listening to me yap, hopping on gmeet calls w me, helping me through my genshin screen time struggles and so much more - you have really seen it all. I miss our long long conversations in the Xiaomi chat and co-oping in genshin together! Thanks for cheering me on and tolerating my bs all the time lol I actually hate the person I was in sec 2 and I'm so sorry u had to experience that and see my horrific bangs every day too... </p>
    <p>Fast forward to upper sec and I am still so so so grateful that we ended up in the same class!!! Even though our fg split up into 3 diff classes I am so glad we managed to stick together and stay close thru it all. I love sitting next to you in history class and watching you watch plan d videos! And I seriously loveee your humour!! Also I just wanted to say 😭 thank you for all the times youve been there for me even through the screen, like when I messed up my piano exam and even when I was crying in school in July. I think that's like something I really still think about cause you didn't know what I was crying about but you were still there for me and lowk that makes me cry even more cause I dont deserve you wtf😭😭😭 youre so sweet stop it</p>
    <p>Also you are such a crazily cool and capable person. Being so serious rn 4T would not be able to function without you. Thank you for always initiating discussions in the welfare chat and solo managing the class insta like that is still so crazy to me + your captions are bomb I wld never be able to spit those bars 😭 Thanks for daring to go where other people don’t (LITERALLY) and remembering the little details... I also admire your heart to serve and how you care so much for those around you and the rest of the world! You are also such a talented and skilful writer and I am so sososososo glad I have had the opportunity to read your work. Thanks for allowing me to look at your cap portfolio like no cap (pun not even intended I'm just funny like that) even after 2022 I wld still read it from time to time...😭 Your statue piece actually shook me to the core. </p>
    <p>You are so beautiful and never let anyone or yourself tell you otherwise. It breaks my heart when u speak about yourself in a negative manner and I often don’t know how to put my thoughts into words but I hope you know that I love you so so much and will alw be here to support you 🙁 I’m really bad with like expressing my thoughts in the right way so I feel like my words alw come out wrong but if you need someone to talk to, lmk and I will try my absolute best 😭🙏🙏 Besides that I am also super sorry for all the times I failed to be a good friend esp last year 😭😭😭 Pls never ever stop texting me I think I wld cry</p>
    <p>Ok I'm not gonna bother with the hope we stay in touch stuff cause we WILL stay in touch I will make sure of it. If we dont I will come and find you and hunt you down in acsi I will trek through that dreary damp dark sch compound just to find u ❤️❤️❤️🤗 okay this is getting a bit long HAHAHAH its almost 2am now .. ok once again, happy grad and I love u so so much pookie</p> 
    <p> </p>
    <p>So much love,</p>
