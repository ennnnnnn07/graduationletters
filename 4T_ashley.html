    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>My dearest Ashley,</p>
    <p>I'm so so grateful that we had the opportunity to meet in SEC 3 I know technically we already met before like in sec 2 and through like CCA and also like going for sasmo together ... like I remember you told me about that time that I asked you what you picked for like the infocom jacket design.... um I actually don't remember that at all but yeah</p>
    <p>I am so so grateful for you being such a steady presence in my life!!! Thank you for sitting across the aisle from me like twice which is literally crazy but anyway I'm so so grateful that you are there for me, even when I'm super down or I'm complaining about like various things I'm just randomly concerned about and everything going on in my life, you are still so steady and just there for me and I'm so so grateful for that fact. I can't believe that it's already been 2 years with you!</p>
    <p>You are so smart and so good at math and like... everything... and I'm really grateful that you always entertain my silly questions whether it be physics or math or chem or anything in general and okay um tbh I lost my passion for physics LOL!!! I kind of miss being in like that little discussion circle we have in class but anyway I'm just so grateful that you are always there for me to answer my questions and just be there for me in general. </p>
    <p>And thank you for being a really good birthday twin I literally couldn't ask for anyone else! Also you're so funny I really miss our long long conversations especially past 10:00 p.m. when you can only like react to my messages which is super funny! And thank you for always being the first to wish happy birthday in the class chat after I wish happy birthday in the important chat because it actually gives me so much anxiety when nobody replies..</p>
    <p>Anyway, you are so kind and talented, hardworking, diligent and smart and thank you for your constant reminder to tuck in my shirt and also in general for us to braid our hair... Youre actually one of the most diligent prefects I know</p>
    <p>I want you to know that you are so capable and you're so like amazing and I just look up to you so much. I pray that we will also be able to stay close throughout our acsi life and are you taking PCM cause I hope you are!!! Then maybe we can see each other even if we are not in the same class... but yeah I pray that everything will be okay and that we'll stay in close contact + as close as we are in mg!! I love you so much and have a really good holiday!!!!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Lots of love,</p>
    <p>Your birthday twin, annoying lock to ur caged bird, sasmo buddy, confused aisle mate SAM K!!!</p>
