    <p>My dearest joy,</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for being such a steady friend the past 2 years! I'm so grateful that we met and I'm really grateful that you're one of the first few friends that I made in sec 3. I remember that at first it was that you me and portia and we were having fun during like the Icebreaker activities and I'm so glad that I got to meet you so early in the year!! And that we worked on our cap portfolios together and like going through all of that stuff and the submission was like a crazy ride... but anyway thats super long ago</p>
    <p>I just can't believe that I've known you for two years now and it really feels like we vibe so well and I'm just so eternally grateful to have you in my life!!! You're such a good study buddy unironically I am so so grateful for the times that we sat together for chinese or history etc! I really like studying with you after school like the time that we studying together after school was when I really really locked in and also started liking staying back in school a lottt more cause before that I would just rush back home HAHAHA

Somehow you always know all the right things to say and I'm really just so grateful for your presence in my life and I really want to thank you for being such a good friend to me even though sometimes I don't understand certain things TT but I'm really just grateful for you and I really couldn't ask for a better seat partner in the past 2 years.</p>
