    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <P>my dearest elizabeth:</P>
    <p>heres all the stuff i didnt put in your grad letter! and in case ure wondering where the emo nonsense went, ummm i deleted all of it yayay heres a stripped and watered down ver! im trying to be less emo for the new year lets make it our new years resolution</p>
    <p>sorry for being so weird all the time btw the gist of literally every letter i write to you is "I love u soooo much and ure so cool" which is true but also im constantly worried u hate me sometimes i think it's your dry texting. im not good with words idk what to say sometimes and im always scared to say the wrong thing so yahhhh lowkey sometimes i feel like our friendship isn't real cause i rlly never expected us to get this close it kinda hit me when we were supposedly watching the ocean that day. like i will never again be sixteen sitting on the rocks next to u watching the beautiful sky and ocean and that kinda made me sad like oh my freak i cant enjoy the freaking view in peace.. kidding i didnt actl think that alone but yeah it made me kind of #sad  </p>
    <p>i think i care a lot about what other people think of me but more than anything i care ab what u think of me which is pretty odd cause ive told u the most random things ab myself, shown u the most cringe parts of my past and cried so hard in front of u i think if anyone were to form a bad impression of me it wld probs be you üòÖ but thats just how life goes and i have nothing but praise and thanks to God for bringing us tgt. even if this friendship has given me more stress and anxiety than any otherüòÇ</p>
    <p>i know im not one of ur best friends but i just wanted to tell u that ure my fav friend ü•∞ i dont think this kinda stuff ab other people much less say it to them.. so yeah thanks for reading.. pls leave me a message!!!!!! sorry for the emo junkyard i actl cried multiple times writing the original so it's gone now lol. before u redownload insta pls lmk so i can unsend u all the cute reels i saw cause i realised they actl sound kinda gay i promise im not gay üòÜüê¨ </p>
    <p>what an odd friendship we have tbh i bet u dont have another rando in ur dms telling u the most sappy bs in a completely platonic way and then telling u shes not gay (cause im not) and tbh i feel like maybe im keeping stuff from u (this entire letter is what im lowkey too scared to tell u sometimes cause ure gna HATEEE me) but ya here it is. there's more but i cant think of the words </p>
    <p>one day i might actl have to remove u from my tele channel idk.. can u tell when im talking ab u in it???? cause i think its pretty obv.. actl pls lmk i actl wna know.. also the thing is that lowkey ure just in a league of your own.. like a special category of friendship and nobody else is in it</p>
    <p>im sorry your europe trip wasnt great cause u deserve so, so much and after all your effort this year i believe you deserve a great trip. when we're older mayb lets go somewhere together!  </p>
    <p>i miss u sooo much lets go somewhere agn tgt or go out or smt yay see you next year cause i will def not see you bef 2024 ends</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>all my love,</p>
    <p>samantha</p>
