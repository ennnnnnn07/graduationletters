    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>My dearest Elsa,</p>
    <p>Happy graduation! I can't believe it's been four years already! So glad we've been in the same class since sec 1 (let's ignore sec 2)... esp in sec 1 I was lowkey kinda terrified cause I didn't have any rgps friends in 1R (all of them were in 1g bruh) and i was scared that i would have nooooo friends but having you and everyone else who was at our lunch table was so good like we had such a good time and I was lowkey not really a core member of that frined group looking back??? like idk how to phrase but yah ykwim.. So grateful you guys ate lunch w me and yuwei and everything esp after swimming!!!! Like that's really a core memory for me and from time to time I still see the picture of you and your piss coloured water bottle cause you put the popsicle into your water bottle.................... 
    </p>
    <p>So glad we ended up in the same class again in sec 3!!!!!!!!! You are so cool and funny and hardworking and I'm so glad we're friends bruh also youre super talented esp in math and LITERALLY SO MANY OTHER ASPECTS + youre so hardworking and i can really see how much effort you put into everything that you do!!! I'm just really so grateful that God brought us back tgt and that we got even closer over the past 2 years. I'm rlly so blessed to have you! You are a brilliant yap buddy and I love taking long long walks with you and having long conversations w you! I am super sorry for all the times I leave you on delivered or forget to reply or I'm just a little iffy... I rlly wanna apologise for that</p>
    <p>Anyway thank you for telling me about your sji guy and letting me know about the stuff going on in your life! Please never stop giving me life updates I love the vibe when we text! Also i'll never forget the time we did the sunflower thing for elise's birthday and I'm so glad i did it with you actually the whole sunflower dying in my lap thing was pretty funny..........</p>
    <p>Your presence in my life is so so truly appreciated and I'm so grateful that through all the friendship/friend group drama etc and being scared of our class (Mostly me actually) and everything youve been such a steady friend and I just couldn't ask for anyone better. I'm so so grateful God put you in my life!</p>
    <p>Also like I remember in July during my thing w elizabeth lim you sat with me for like two hours???????? Like I just rmb how I started ugly crying in the middle of the canteen and u brought me to the secret toilet and when it started raining OMD. life is crazy. youre so caring and thank you for being there for me and CHOOSING to be there for me even though u cld have been at lunch w arielle etc and enjoying your lunch!!!!! thank you for comforting me and ALSO you actl give me the best reality checks ever and the best advice. Like even after lunch i can't believe you still came with me to find her and support me and even go find other people like nat mah etc... and it's just been such a crazy year and I'm so grateful you were there with me. And thanks for asking other people like labiba for advice I'm just so touched by that omd.. thank you so much for caring youre so kind and thoughtful i love u so much </p>
    <p>Besides that thank you for being a great groupmate for planning for Charis' birthday! And the time that we did NOI together was sooooo fun I really love sitting beside you in infocomm!!!! Thank you for joining infocomm!!!!!!!!!! Oops also the time that we had a miscommunication about code quest umm IM REALLY SORRY TT I'm glad that we got through it really fast and code Quest didn't even end up happening so that's quite funny </p>
    <p>Let's join noi together next year! ok wait no I don't actually mean that I don't want to join noi with the acsi guys. But let's continue coding tgt I think it's so fun. Acting for last year's talentime together was also super fun like wow ure my secret hot ai boyfriend ... Anyway I think you're such a kind and talented person and you are so thoughtful and caring and hardworking and diligent and like I literally could go on for hours but you are so cool and really grateful to be your friend! I find it kind of scary how you know everything and how you have so many connections everywhere</p>
    <p>I could literally go on for hours but I'm actually running out of time to write these letters (this was written on 10 nov!) so I will just end here for now because I trust that there will still be many many more years of memories together and I'm just so grateful that we're going to be taking PCM together like even if we don't end up taking PCMe together I'm just grateful that will be taking like a really similar subject combi!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
    <p>Please always text me and I'm really really sorry if I leave you on delivered because sometimes I just really will miss the message.... and that's yeah that's my bad</p>
    <p>Thank you so much for everything!!! please let's go out sometime and get acai or wingstop or mala or something idk i just want to spend time with you I love talking to you hehe
