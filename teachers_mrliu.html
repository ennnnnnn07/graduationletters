    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>dear mr liu,</p>
    <p>thanks for being such a great physics teacher over the past two years! i'm so glad we had you as our physics teacher and i love our tight-knit class dynamic. i can really see the passion you have for the subject and that really helped me to start liking physics more too! actually other than SJPO i joined SPhL too (with nat mah, anna wee and audrey leng from 4G!) and it was way more fun than expected (btw we got silver heheh!) you really helped me to see the fun in physics and enjoy it way more than i did in lower sec. </p>
    <p>thanks for inviting me to the FGD and believing in my potential and giving me the opportunity to go for the HTX attachment! (it was really fun, i made some friends and learnt a lot there yay)</p>
    <P>thank you for your beautifully designed notes as well, your analogies are so funny but somehow they work HAHA. i love your snoopy pictures too, please don't stop putting them in your notes for future generations! theyre like a nice little surprise after a long day of attempting to understand electricity... </P>
    <p>anyway, thank you so much for everything! i am praying for you and your family and i hope you stop overworking yourself, get a good rest over the holidays, and can spend more time with your family too! merry christmas and happy new year in advance!
    </p>
