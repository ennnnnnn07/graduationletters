    <h2>letter for you...</h2>
    <p>Dearest Kim,</p>
    <p>Happy grad! I can't believe that it has been ten years already lol that's actually so crazy to me... I'm so glad God put you in my life and let us have the opportunity to meet again in MG and even be in the same class for three years! </p>
    <p>You are such a kind, talented and hardworking person and I'm so grateful to be one of your friends. You are an excellent leader, don't put yourself down esp when it comes to class chairing cause I think youve really improved a lot over the past year and youre really doing very great!!!! </p>
    <p>You are so crazy skilled in so many areas like math and dance and crochet and so much more and it's actually crazy how you stay on top of everything. We love a committed and busy queen but also remember to take breaks because we DONT love an overworked queen. I mean we do but dont overwork urself cause we would be really sad then. </p>
    <p>Planning for arielle and charis' bdays together was super fun and I really enjoy taking long walks with you! Going for FOA 1 together was also really fun heheh let's go out again and match cargo pants! Thank you for listening to me yap all the time about church and friends and pizza and literally everything under the sun, and being there for me when I was super down or ugly crying lollll and thanks for inviting me to your church! I don't appreciate the poaching attempts but I do appreciate the thought HAHAHAHAHA anyway I hope we stay close throughout acsi as well! I know we'll def stay physically close (unless u move......... but preferably don't)</p>
    <p>Talking to you is the most fun thing ever and please neverrr ever stop texting me I love talking to you so much! And thank you for showing me your writing ITS RLLY VERY GOOD you are a mad talented person.... and thanks for telling me about your life and asking me for advice ab guys or just telling me ab ur life (although I cannot really help most of the time but YA I APPRECIATE!!!)</p>
    <p>I love you so so much and I'm eternally grateful to have you in my life. Stay safe and happy and have a great time in Germany! (this was written in nov... i hope you had a great time...) And remember not to pack your holidays full of activities and not leave time for rotting or doing what you like... Although knowing you I'm worried that you already have HAHAHAHAH</p>
