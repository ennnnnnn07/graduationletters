    <p>Dearest Alicia,</p>
    <p>Happy grad! I'm so glad we ended up in the same class last year heheh thanks for being such a wonderful friend and a great listener! Thank you for letting me sit at your lunch table and listening to me yap, even about my tuition friend dilemmas and teaching us various Chinese jokes LOOLLL I love your Chinese handwriting AND your English handwriting and your many french braids. Your hair is gorgeous don't let anyone or yourself tell you otherwise. You are so talented and hardworking and I look up to you so much! </p>
    <p>I hope we stay close next year too and still eat lunch together even though we r def not going to be in the same class... Stay healthy and happy and I hope your holidays are amazing! (Couldn't think of another h word lol) Love you lots Alicia!</p>
